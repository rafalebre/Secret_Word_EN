# Secret Word

## Description

Secret Word is a simple, engaging word guessing game developed as part of my React learning journey. In this game, players are given hints based on the category of the word (e.g., body, sciences, food, etc.) and must guess the word correctly to score points. Each incorrect letter guess costs the player one attempt. Successfully guessing the entire word awards points to the player. The game dynamically chooses a category and a word within that category to challenge the player, enhancing the learning experience with varied and thematic hints.

## Motivation

This project was created during a React course to apply and test my burgeoning skills in React and CSS styling. The aim was to create a fun and interactive way to engage with React's capabilities while also challenging myself to improve my CSS styling.

## Installation

This game requires only React and NPM to run. Here are the steps to get it started on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. To start the game, execute `npm start`. The game will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the game starts, a word category is displayed as a hint for the player. Your task is to guess the word related to the hint given. Each incorrect letter guess will reduce your attempts by one. Successfully guessing all the letters of the word before running out of attempts will award you points. The game offers a series of words across different categories to test your guessing skills.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
