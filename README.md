# Secret Word

## Description

Secret Word is a simple, engaging word guessing game developed as part of my React learning journey. In this game, players are given hints based on the category of the word (e.g., body, sciences, food, etc.) and must guess the word correctly to score points. Each incorrect letter guess costs the player one attempt. Successfully guessing the entire word awards points to the player. The game dynamically chooses a category and a word within that category to challenge the player, enhancing the learning experience with varied and thematic hints.

## Motivation

This project was created during a React course to apply and test my burgeoning skills in React and CSS styling. The aim was to create a fun and interactive way to engage with React's capabilities while also challenging myself to improve my CSS styling.

## Installation

This game requires only React and NPM to run. Here are the steps to get it started on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. To start the game, execute `npm start`. The game will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the game starts, a word category is displayed as a hint for the player. Your task is to guess the word related to the hint given. Each incorrect letter guess will reduce your attempts by one. Successfully guessing all the letters of the word before running out of attempts will award you points. The game offers a series of words across different categories to test your guessing skills.
